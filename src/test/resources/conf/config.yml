  # This mbean is to get cluster related metrics.

    metrics:
      include:
        - Members : "Members"  # If this attribute is removed, nodeIds will be seen in the metric paths and not their corressponding names.
        - ClusterSize : "ClusterSize"

    metrics:
      include:
        - CacheHits : "CacheHits" #The rough number of cache hits since the last time statistics were reset. A cache hit is a read operation invocation (that is, get()) for which an entry exists in this map.
          delta: true
        - CacheMisses : "CacheMisses" #The rough number of cache misses since the last time statistics were reset.
        - CachePrunes : "CachePrunes" #The number of prune operations since the last time statistics were reset. A prune operation occurs every time the cache reaches its high watermark as specified by the HighUnits attribute.
        - TotalGets : "TotalGets" #The total number of get() operations since the last time statistics were reset.
        - TotalPuts : "TotalPuts" #The total number of put() operations since the last time statistics were reset.
        - UnitFactor : "UnitFactor" #The factor by which the Units, LowUnits and HighUnits properties are adjusted. Using a BINARY unit calculator, for example, the factor of 1048576 could be used to count megabytes instead of bytes.
        - Units : "Units" #The size of the cache measured in units. This value needs to be adjusted by the UnitFactor.
        - Size : "Size" #The number of entries in the cache.

  # This mbean will give cache node specific metrics.
